\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}

    \item What is the subject of the study? Describe the
        economic/econometric problem.
        
        Airbnb (airbnb.com) is now a famous website allowing private people and commercial entities to rent out part of their spaces. It all started in 2007 when two 27-year-olds decided to sublet their living room in their San Francisco apartment during a conference to help pay their rent \citep{airbnbstory:2012}.

We therefore attempt an exploratory analysis of Airbnb listings in Berlin and, in particular, of their price. For this purpose also the properties were also clustered and....

    As in \cite{wang2017price} summarized, in the case of hotels, hotel prices are negatively influenced by the hotel's location, since shorter distance from the city center, the main attractions and/or important transportation points leads to higher prices. On the other side positive influences on price are hotels'star rating and online customer rating, the services and amenities provided, and by the "presense of car parks and fitness centers". But price determinants could be different in case of different types of accomodations, such as the ones offered on Airbnb. That's why \cite{wang2017price} also derived the drivers of price for Airbnb listings from 33 cities.


    \item Provide an overview of your results.
