\section{Results and Conclusions}\label{Sec:Conc}

\begin{itemize}

    \item Give a short summary of what has been done and what has been
    found.
    
Airbnb is a relevant subject in this day and age where sharing economy has affected most business fields. Therefore there have been many studies about Airbnb, in relation to hotels \citep{wang2017price}, and to the rental market \citep{coles2017airbnb}.

In this study we focused on the properties based in Berlin, the capital of Germany. We looked at how the properties are distributed across the cities, noting that most of them are in the central part of town, the one inside the circular line. We further explored the distribution of different attributes, identifying differences across the multiple the districts and neighbourhoods.

As to be expected, most of the properties have at least one station within 1km, being fast to the center an important factor when choosing accomodation.
